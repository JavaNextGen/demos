# CSS

-   **Cascading Style Sheets**
    -   A language for styling html
    -   It specifies certain rules for layout and display of HTML elements
    -   **uses key/value pairs** to indivate the styling to apply
    -   Style Sheets are a **simple but powerful** way of changing our HTML Document
        -   **CAN** be used to make our HTML more pleasant
    -   CSS is broken down into the key value pairs
        -   **Selector**
            -   Defines the element(s) you are styling
        -   **Declaration**
            -   Defines the style you are trying to impose on the select

```css
p {
	background-color: red;
	color: white;
}
```

## CSS Box Model

![CSS Box Model](https://miro.medium.com/max/408/1*sKnLrT1TtqWDZg7GWoBCow.png)

-   CSS treats each element in the document as one of those "boxes"
-   Each box has it own 4 regions
    -   can styled independently from one another
-   From outer to inner regions:
    -   _Margin_
        -   The outermost layer
        -   Useful for separating elements from one another
        -   Dimensions are given by the margin-box width and height
    -   _Border_
        -   The layer between the margin and padding
        -   Dimensions are width and height
    -   _Padding_
        -   The layer around the content area and within the border-box
        -   Dimensions given width and height of the padding box
    -   **Content**
        -   Consists all the content for that elmeent, images, other media (video ads)
        -   Its bound to the content
        -   dimens are given by width and height

## Where can put the CSS

-   Three places to declare our CSS
    -   **Externally**
        -   making a ".css" file that you refer too
        -   generally helpful for large amounts
    -   **Internally**
        -   apply the css internally in the header
        -   \<style>\</style>
        -   contained within a style
    -   **Inline**
        -   in the element tag
-   Conflicts:
    -   External < Internal < Inline(is king)
    -   the more specifi you are with your CSS the higher priority

## CSS Properties

-   There are ALOT and I MEAN ALOT of properties that can be styled
-   Border:
    -   border width
    -   border style (dashed, dotted, none etc)
    -   border color
-   Padding
    -   Padding top/right/botton/left
    -   Giving the generic padding numbers will shorthand fill out those options
        -   1 number
            -   ALL four sides will be the same
            -   square
            -   {padding:70px;}
        -   2 numbers
            -   first number is the top and bottom
            -   second number is the left and right
            -   {padding: 35px 70px;}
        -   3 numbers
            -   first number is the top
            -   second is left and right
            -   third number is the bottom
            -   {padding: 35 px 70px 10px}
        -   4 numbers
            -   first is the top
            -   Second is the right
            -   Third is the bottom
            -   Fourth is the left
-   Margin
    -   similar to the padding just on the other side of the border
-   Display
    -   dtermine whether it's an inline or block element (changes the display behavior)
-   **Position**
-   **Static**
-   **Relative**
-   **Absolute**
-   **Fixed**
-   **Color**
-   **Text-Align**

### CSS Selectors

-   _Element Selectors_
    -   selects all the instances of an html element that is defined

```css
p {
	text-align: center;
	color: blue;
}
```

-   _ID selector_
    -   Selects by the ID attribute of the element
    -   IDs should be unique (can repeat them, if you want to apply to multiple things)
    -   Uses the # to select all elements with this ID

```css
#login-header {
	text-align: center;
	color: blue;
}
```

-   _Class Selector_
    -   will style any element the declared class attribute
    -   Have multiple classes in an element class attribute
        -   class="table table-darkened", tough to do on your own, so trust in Bootstrap
    -   Use the . to select
    -   combine them with the element selector

## ** CHECK THIS **

```css
.intro {
	text-align: center;
	color: blue;
}

p.intro {
	text-align: center;
	color: red;
}
```

-   _Universal Selector_
    -   selects everything
    -   Uses thes \*

```css
* {
	text-align: center;
	color: pink;
}
```

-   _Attribute Selector_
    -   Allows you to selects elmenets that declares specific attributes
    -   Use the [] to select

```css
[title] {
	text-align: left;
	color: green;
}
```

-   _Grouping Selectors_
    -   you can group multiple selects and apply the same style
    -   simply declar the selectors and separate with a comma

```css
h1,
#para1,
.intro {
	text-align: left;
	color: green;
}
```

-   _Child Selectors_
    -   selects specific elements that are direct child of a specific type of element
    -   uses the > symbol to select

```css
div > * {
	text-align: left;
	color: red;
}
```

-   **Conflicts**
    -   IF selectors conlfict with each other the "WINNING" css is determined by specificity
        -   ID wins over everything
        -   Class beats anything besides ID
        -   Element is the lowest priority

### Bootstrap Grid System

-   Layout called the grid system
    -   consists of containers which contain rows, which themselves contain columns
    -   This layout will be responsive to window size changes
-   This grid system allows use to acheive our **repsonsive web design**
-   **Containers**
    -   are the basic layour elements used to wrap the content of a web page
    -   There are two provided container classes:
        -   _Container_
            -   resposnsive fixed width
        -   _Contianer-fluid_
            -   Always prefer to span the entire viewport
-   _Rows_
    -   are the horizontal slices of a container
    -   they are created simply by a "row" class
    -   Rows have a base size of 12px
-   _Columns_
    -   coulmuns have a dynamic width determined by their size relative to the size of the row
    -   **IF** the size of a column exeeds 12
        -   the column exceeding the size will be moved below the columns that do not
    -   class="col-sm-4"
        -   col is for column
        -   the sm represents the default size of the column
        -   4 is a relative size compared to the 12

        -   class="table-dark table-bordered table-striped"
            -   "zebra" striping to our darkened, bordered table
-   Bootstrap forms use the "form-control" class
    -   you can then use the "col" class like you would in a row to ouline the shape of the form
